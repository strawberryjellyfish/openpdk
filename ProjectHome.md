Pleo is a robotic dinosaur marketed as a kind of electronic pet, but also usable as a reasonably generic robotics platform. It is programmable with the Pawn scripting language using the Pleo Development Kit (PDK).

Due to the license of the official PDK, developing for Pleo can be tricky - this project seeks to fix that by offering free tools that are unencumbered.

In addition, the hope is to provide extra tools for interfacing to the pleo via USB and anything else of relevance.
